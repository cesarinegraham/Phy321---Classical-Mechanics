# Phy321---Classical-Mechanics
Codes written in Python for MSU's Classical Mechanics course, taught by Dr. Hjorth- Jensen.

The codes will cover the following topics both analytically and numerically:

1) Newton's Laws of Motion
2) Intertial frames and their relation to accelerating and rotating frames
3) Forces, work, energy, angular momentum, linear momentum, and conservation laws
4) Energy diagrams and effective potential
5) Small oscillations, Harmonic oscillator potentials, and equations of motion
6) Transformation of variables
7) Variational calculus and Lagrangian formalisms
8) Lagrangian multipliers
9) Euler-Cromer and Velocity-Verlet algorithms
10) Runge-Kutta family of algorithms for time-dependent forces
11) Numerical integration with the Trapezoidal, midpoint, and Simpon's rules
